# Network and Cryptographic programming
Dr. Manshaei
Web Programming Homework

#1. Preliminaries:
Both Client and Server have a pair of asymmetric keys, so they should be able to carry out
asymmetric cryptographic functions. These two entities should communicate over a socket
connection (not web service).
#2. The Overall Scenario:

1. The client sends a register request to the server and server must reply this request. At
the end of registration process, server should have access to the clientâ€™s username,
password and public key. Moreover, client needs to know the server's public key.
2. The client sends its username and password along (inside) a request for hashing a
value (user input) to the server. The value should be sent encrypted in a way that only
the server can decrypt.
3. Server computes the hash of that value and then sends the result to the client. The
result should be sent encrypted in a way that only the client can decrypt.
4. After a successful cycle, client will send a "Thank You" message to the server as a
sign of connection termination.
#3. Non-functional Requirements:
You are free to choose any programming language but we recommend Java. You should use
SHA256 as Hash algorithm and RSA (key length=1024), as asymmetric cryptographic
algorithm.
